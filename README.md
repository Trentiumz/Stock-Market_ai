# STOCK MARKET AI
This is my attempt at create an ai that can make stock market decisions; it's not so much 
for actually making money as it is just trying out different types of ai, so enjoyyyy

### Data
This folder contains the data that this model will be using to train

### Attempt 1
This is the first attempt, using a recursive neural network to predict whether or not the next
"significant event" will be a peak or bottom. Using this, we can buy as long as the next "significant event" is a peak,
and sell when it's a bottom.
